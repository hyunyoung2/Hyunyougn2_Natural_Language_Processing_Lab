# Python Code 

 I will continuously arrange the set of the python code associated with natural Language processing right here
 
 And The key point is the set of code arranged right here is basic codes like this :
 
 N-gram of syllable, word count and so on. 
 
 The reason why I decided to arrange the code is :
 
 First, For me 
 
 - When I need the idea of the set of this code, and then probably I will resue and update this code for my future project
 
 Second, For someone and teammates 
 
 - Teammates is in my natural language labs at kookmin university, So I hope as follows  :
 
     - I get an new idea to make it cool from teammate 
  
     - This code helps my teammate to do programming and gives my teammate an idea associated with their project
 
 - Someone who do natural language processing, So I hope as follows :
 
     - I get an idea from their perspective that they see this code, 
  
     - This code helps them to do project and get an idea.
